Usage example for php on windows machine:
C:\xampp\php>C:\xampp\php\php-cgi.exe -f "C:\xampp\htdocs\apl_autofile\index.php"
<p>
hello world
</p>
C:\xampp\php>

Note you need to specify full path to both files and use php-cgi.exe instead of php.exe.
I have however found on windows that after first run php-cgi gets corrupted to 0KB
